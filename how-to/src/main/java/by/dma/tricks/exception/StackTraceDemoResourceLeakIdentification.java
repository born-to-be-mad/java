 * be can be
 * hard to trace, and can lead to resource leaks.  Some resources are not cleaned up when the GC frees the object e.g
 * . a RandomAccessFile object is cleaned up on a GC by the file it represents isnâ€™t closed unless you close it,
 * leading to a potential resource leak of file handles.
