# Optimized setting for Intellij Idea:

## Clean the view
* *Navigation Bar* - OFF. This is really useful option to save space. You can always view navigation bar by 'Alt+home'.
* *Breadscrumbs* - deactivate it to save space, cause it has no sense in *.java files.
* *Highlight usages of element at caret*(Settings > General) - it is rather irritating option which is active by default. You can always highlight the element under the caret by 'Shift+Ctrl+F7'.
* *Editor > Color scheme > General: section 'Editor', property 'Caret row'* - deactivate the checkbox 'Background'.
* *Editor > Color scheme > Language Defaults, property 'Semantic highlighting'* - activate the checkbox 'Semantic highlighting'
